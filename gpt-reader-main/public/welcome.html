        <p>Thank you for installing me. I am here to help you with your screen reading needs.

            After you have done that, right click on the extension icon and select options to set up the connection to Chat GPT using an API Key that you can setup at OpenAI just go to platform.openai.com
            When that is setup you can launch me by clicking on the extension or using the keyboard shortcut command+shift+space. <br>
