This extension was written as a final university project in the possibility of using LLMs to give visually impaired students a chance to learn and gain knowledge from the internet.

Traditional screen readers are extremely simplistic, slow and can't provide context to the user. With the ability to integrate AI, you are able to learn a lot more than what is just displayed on the screen. Therefore, I thought of coming up with this programme that would work with screen readers to add onto what the traditional screen readers lack.


## Features

- Describe a web page using image analysis of the web page
- Ask a specific question about the site in text. It doesn't have to be something included in the general description
- Record a short audio clip of you asking a question about the page

## Install

To power the extension you need an OpenAI API Key.

[OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)

Create an account, add some limited funding and generate a key.
All initial development and testing of the extension cost $0.50

I would however reccomend turning off auto-topup and enforcing spending limits just to make sure.
