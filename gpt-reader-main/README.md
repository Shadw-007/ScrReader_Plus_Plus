This extension was written as a final university project in the possibility of using Language Learning Modules (LLMs) to give visually impaired students a chance to learn and gain knowledge from the internet.

Tradisional screen readers are extremely simplistic, slow and can't provide context to the user. With the ability to integrate AI, you are able to learn a lot more than what is just displayed on the screen.


Ohh and of course, please do not fully rely on the answers provided and expect some rough endges.

## Features

- Describe a web page using image analysis of the web page
- Ask a specific question about the site in text. It doesn't have to be something included in the general description
- Record a short audio clip of you asking a question about the page

## Install

To power the extension you need an OpenAI API Key.

[OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)

Create an account, add some limited funding and generate a key.
All initial development and testing of the extension cost $0.50

I would however reccomend turning off auto-topup and enforcing spending limits just to make sure.


## Contribution

 

Here's a list of potential enhancements and features to consider:
- Addition of more keyboard shortcuts.
- Capability to record while a keyboard shortcut is being held down.
- Provision of a structured approach around a user goal and chat history.
